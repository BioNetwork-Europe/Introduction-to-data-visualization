Introduction
===============
In the modern research landscape, the volume of data that researchers typically handle has skyrocketed. In many projects, this has introduced a difficulty in performing exploratory data analysis. This is true especially in locally owned resource limited computing infrastructures. With a combination of powerful, shared, and scalable computing infrastructure like NAIC (Norwegian AI Cloud) and using advanced visualization tools, the problem can be solved. We intend this training material for researchers who plan to use the NAIC infrastructure for their large data visualization tasks.

Why use NAIC for Visualization?
--------------------------------
Here, we discuss some examples to showcase the need for HPC visualization.

.. note::
   TODO: Add a featured image here.

How does this work?
--------------------
.. note::
   TODO: Add basic information regarding parallel processing and remote visualization.

Who gets the benefit?
-----------------------
.. note::
   TODO: Add a list/image representing the beneficiary domain/research groups. Connect the same with relevant example list as well.

What data types are covered in examples?
---------------------------------------------
.. note::
   TODO: Add an image link map that shows a summary of different types of supported datatypes. It should be linked to examples discussing the selected datatype.
