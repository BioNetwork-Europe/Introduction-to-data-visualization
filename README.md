# HPC Visualization
## Description
This course aims to provide a concise introduction to data visualization by leveraging the power of the NAIC infrastructure. With this training material, we intend to support researchers who wants to perform exploratory data analysis and visualization on large datasets. Here, we will demonstrate the use of sophisticated visualization tools/techniques. The example materials will serve as a reference template the users can adapt in their projects.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge in Python.
- Basic knowledge in Linux commands.
